# Environmental Conditions Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes environmental conditions within a facility, focusing on key parameters: ambient temperature (AT), ambient pressure (AP), relative humidity (RH), exhaust vacuum (PE), and ambient moisture (V). The goal is to enhance energy efficiency and optimize operational performance through comprehensive data analysis.

## Features
- Analysis of five key environmental parameters: AT, AP, RH, PE, and V.
- Insights to improve energy management and HVAC system optimization.
- Identification of opportunities for operational efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following measurements:
- **Ambient Temperature (AT)**: Measured in degrees Celsius.
- **Ambient Pressure (AP)**: Measured in hPa (hectopascals).
- **Relative Humidity (RH)**: Measured in percentage (%).
- **Exhaust Vacuum (PE)**: Measured in mmHg.
- **Ambient Moisture (V)**: Measured in percentage (%).

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AydinXudiyev/environmental-conditions-analysis.git
cd environmental-conditions-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
